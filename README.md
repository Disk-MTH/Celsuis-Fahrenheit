A very little project (one of my first) to lean "for", "while", "do while" buckles. The code is very bad but it work and I hav'nt the time to remake it with GUI ...
So you can take the code and do what you want with it !
To use the jar, you have to download it and execute with this command : java -jar converter celsuis-fahrenheit.jar
